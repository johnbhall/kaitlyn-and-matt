      <h2>Getting Around Washington, D.C.</h2>
      
      <p>
        It is very easy to make your way around the city &mdash; DC is very tourist friendly!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>Taxis</em> are available from all the airports and Union Station and are easily accessible in the city. To get around the downtown area, the fare will range from $4 to $15, with an additional fee for extra passengers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We frequently use <em>Uber</em>, a car service app, to get around. If you don't already have it on your phone, <a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/ouv0h">use this link</a> to sign up and get your first ride free.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em><a href="http://wmata.com">The Metro</a></em>, DC's subway system, runs to most of the DC sites.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If it's nice weather, we recommend biking the sites! <em><a href="http://www.capitalbikeshare.com">Capital Bikeshare</a></em> is an easy bike rental service, with over 300 bike stations scattered around the city. You can rent by the day, the weekend, or buy a membership.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There are also a number of <em>tour buses</em> that operate out of Union Station. These companies offer hop-on/hop-off services, guided tours, and a number of different routes/destinations.  Let us know if we can be helpful in making a recommendation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="quick-note">
        Just a quick note: Addresses in Washington, D.C. include a direction that tells you which quadrant of the city the address is located in &mdash; Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). These sections of town come together around the U.S. Capitol, which marks the center of the city. You need to be careful because the same street name and number may exist in, for example, NE as well as NW.
